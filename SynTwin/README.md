Here is the step-by-step guide to repeat the work from the paper. Moore JH, Li X, Chang J-H, Tatonetti NP, Theodorescu D, Chen Y, Asselbergs F, Venkatesan M, Wang Z. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, in press (2024).

Create a directory that will hold all input and output of SynTwin and modify `path_to_data` to the directory. Within that, there will be subfolders `Encoded_data`, `Distance_matrices`, `Percolation_threshold`, and `Vital_prediction`. The results of each step will saved to these folders.

step2_mpom_synthetic_dataset can be replaced with any synthetic data generation algorithms that work best for your data.
